Dockerfile that includes rMATS and maser to perform RNA splicing analysis.

- [rMATs v4.1.2](https://github.com/Xinglab/rmats-turbo) - Computational tool to detect differential alternative splicing events from RNA-Seq data.
- [PAIRADISE v1.0](https://github.com/Xinglab/PAIRADISE) - Method for detecting allele-specific alternative splicing (ASAS) from RNA-seq data (required for paired-analysis within rMATS). 
- [maser v1.18.0](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/maser.html) - This package provides functionalities for downstream analysis, annotation and visualizaton of alternative splicing events generated by rMATS.
- [rmats2sashimi v2.0.4](https://github.com/Xinglab/rmats2sashimiplot) - Utility to produce sashimiplot visualizations of rMATS outputs.

To run rMATS, just call `python rmats.py`. Using full path: `python /rmats-turbo/rmats.py`
To run rmats2sashimi call `rmats2sashimiplot`.
Maser and PAIRADISE are already installed within the R environment.
